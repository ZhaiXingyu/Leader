Prepare logo type 3dmax model resources, export the model in FBX format, and then import it into UE4. After the development of the AR function is completed, the  models such as arrows will fall to the ground after the user clicks the ground.
Create a user interface class, including buttons to zoom in, zoom out, and rotate to control the logo model on the ground.
When the user clicks the button, the sound effect will play, and the audio file format must be the WAV format.
The self-illumination of the model can be controlled through the "light" button on the user interface.
